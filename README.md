# Harry-Potter-RAG-Q&A

# Document Q&A Application using Google Gemma

This project showcases an end-to-end Document Q&A application using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Google Gemma, a family of lightweight, open-source models based on Google’s Gemini research. We’ve built a Q&A chat application specifically for the Harry Potter book series (Books 1-7). You can ask any questions related to the content, and the system will efficiently provide accurate answers using the Groq API for document analysis.
